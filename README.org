#+TITLE: OnlineTA Web Server

Nothing special, just a multiplexer. The fun stuff happens later.

Create the directories =uploads= and =tests=. Place tests for a numerically
indexed assignment under =tests=. The entry program must be called =run.sh=,
and must be executable. For instance, =tests/0/run.sh=.

Starts a Go server at port =8080=, and writes an error log to =error.log=.

For configuring the files which must be there, and which could be there, see
=files.json=.
